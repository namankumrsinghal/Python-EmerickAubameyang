Analyzing the effect of crowds on outcomes of soccer matches

Class Project for BU MET 521

Description:
In Soccer(and many other sports), the home team always seem to have an advantage of having their fans cheering for them, creating an atmosphere to make them perform to their best. This has been a popular observation.
Now, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, soccer matches are played without crowds. This gives an interesting opportunity to study the observation stated above. I have made an attempt to compare the results(at home and away matches) for the last 5 seasons.
The aim of this project is to get to know and play around with major constructs in Python. 


Instructions to run code:
Modules:
The program imports these modules: pandas, os, matplotlib, numpy

Instructions on running the code
Step 1:
When we run the code,  we are prompted for a team name and season(ex: ‘Arsenal’ and 2019). The program is supposed to print out the home record and away record of the team for that season, followed by the total points.

Step 2:
After that, the user is prompted for another input, a season(year)(ex: 2017) to print out the record. Various information is printed(as explained in the summary)

Step 3:
Now, the user is asked to enter Y if he/she wants to run the algorithm for every team in the last 5 seasons and make a comparison plot. Enter Y and the above(step2) runs for the last 5 seasons and makes a bar plot at the end


Note:
I have included the dataset(csv files) for the previous 5 seasons of the English Premier League to test the code. Please change the file path(line4-8) accordingly(I have used the file location in my local computer)

A class called Team is defined in Teams.py file

All datasets used in the project were open source from football-data.co.uk
